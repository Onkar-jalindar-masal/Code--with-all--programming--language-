#write a python program to create a tuple:-


#create tuple with same values:-
tuple1= (10,20,30,40,50)
print(tuple1)


#create tuple with different values:-
tuple2= ("ram",10,"shyam",20,30)
print(tuple2)


#Accessing tuple elements:-
print(tuple1[2])

output:- (10,20,30,40,50)
         ("ram",10,"shyam",20,30
         30
